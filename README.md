# ellipsis_classification_ML_2025
This project evaluates classic machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) for binary classification of ellipsis in text â€” determining whether a sentence contains omitted words or not.

The repository includes:

- Model training & evaluation scripts (accuracy, F1, precision/recall).

- Comparison of traditional ML approaches, highlighting challenges in ellipsis detection.

Designed as a baseline for future NLP research in this field, this work demonstrates the results of classical methods in capturing ellipsis, comparing these results to the work of Cavar et. al. 2024.
